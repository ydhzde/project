## Life is threaten. 
People do things as soon as possible,  but every airport got delays after all.
I ve got so much to be done, yet every thing drove me crazy.
 *——something like "I want to write this in the front"*

> This noon, I dreamed about a big hall in my "school", which was in a ceremony with all my school mates. Also, with the headmaster. Don't remember what he said, but the arrangement of seats was strange -- All struggled to squizzzzzz( very crowd!) in the South area, and no one got a North area seat, so that I was pushed out of the seat area, out of the rail.

It s a dangerous position, but guess what? I kept this with a chair under my butt(what support my weight?I swing?I just hang in the air or?……).  

The speech is not necessary for me to keep focused, but I just waste my time and my security feeling(after all, I sit in the air)

Does this mean that I pursue something that THEY ALL PUESUE, and that I easily forget this is threatening my LIFE?

## Security lost, and being built!

Recently, I was told that I lost some connection with real people, so I adjusted myself to the social mode(Emm...You know, like smiling all the time or so....).

I bumped into my collages on the bus(I seated, she not), then I tried not to hide my head, which I always did in the past, I tried to wave to her and talked about the morning thing such as "Year! the sun./When did you wake up?" I got a focus from my collage. 

I can't image this connection in the past, esp. when I lost in my own world. I seldom talked with my parents, friends, collages, bosses in person. Instead, I photographed myself and podcasted on the website, which attracted few, and obviously I got no response.

the face-to-face talk responded me so quickly, and a little warm-hearted.

I would not to protect myself like I never have security feeling, and open my eye to the real world.

They are  so "familiar" that I almost ignore them.

People like that, so things like that, too.

Once I lost security, when I worried so much about how to get the best past of security and worried little about what I should do.

Now I want to rebuilt security, even it needs a long journey to find the real feeling in my heart.  Dont be afraid, just on my way to figure out all behind!

- Next time I will write my comments on *Hilda*. Continue with all  your attention, please~
