榆树下的欲望
Greed as a grievous weakness in human nature often leads to tragedy and this evil is extremely manifested on the second wife of Ephraim Cabot, Cabot, Eben and Abbie to varying degrees by O'Neil. It seems the second wife Maw is the root of evil but actually Cabot sets the model to his family as the greediest person in Desire Under the Elms. Maw, the mother of Eben planted the greedy seed in Eben’s mind. She worked very hard with Cabot and had their farmland even for overworking on which she died. When she was alive she told Eben the farmland was hers and then it should be fully inherited by Eben without thinking about the benefits of Simeon and Peter, two half-brothers to Even from the first wife of Cabot. Therefore, Eben sponsors Simeon and Peter to seek their dream of gold in California's gold fields by the condition that they give up their share of the farm, which reveals Eben’s greed. Abbie is greedier than Eben since she thirsts for possessing both love and property without being legally and morally awarded. She could attain her end by hook or by crook such as marrying an unloved old man, 40 years older than her, and even sacrificing her own son to reach to her purpose. However, the big boss Cabot is the greediest character in this play, who sets the greedy model for the people around him. He utilizes his wife to reproduce offspring and produce fortune but treats them very badly. He knows how to aggregate fortune but is unaware of winning people’s hearts. He marries Abbie because he loves her youth and bearing function but not because he truthfully loves her while Abbie conditionally marries him because she thinks that he could let her settle down and offer guarantee for her future life. In the process of chasing interest, from Cabot the characters know that love is the least important thing. Consequently, Cabot becomes the unloved person to the around people and his wives and sons always resent him. His excessive greed results in the tragedy he would never be happy since everyone leaves him, he finally owns the farmland alone without any threats though.Greed as a grievous weakness in human nature often leads to tragedy and this evil is extremely manifested on the second wife of Ephraim Cabot, Cabot, Eben and Abbie to varying degrees by O'Neill.
