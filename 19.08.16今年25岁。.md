### Focusing one maybe my old studying mode.

when I was at the college, I can't understand the "T" mode, and I study all the time just for my final examinations and my essays, which means it s totally "diligent"  that I usually study anything of something.

But

 - [ ] How to be Beautiful?
 - [ ] what is the lifestyle just for me?
 - [ ] Can I fall in love once？(and promise I will not hurt myself?)
 - [ ] How to perfect Cooking and Cleaning?
 - [ ] If my mates are in a mess arguement, What Should I do!?

I learned little. 

When my roommates started to disgust with each other, I just ran away from our room, always lying in the playground behind our room which is called the South athlete place or sitting in the dine even there is no meal supporting then.

 ## what about studying "something of anything" ? 
When I went to the working area, I first were a Pre-K to K English teacher, I can't figure out my career, I mean, I don't know if I would be the "mild and weak" teacher for the rest of my life.
Of course, with such kind of emotion, my job aims not so highly as others do.
sometimes, I felt tired of taking good care of Pre-K children, even if their parents talked all the problems we met that day after class.

I tried to image that they are my kids and I felt responsible only for that month or two.

Few months later, I fell again, into that "I can't teach well" & "What if I just keep doing like this and things would be improved just next day!( the last hope like a glim of light) "

## a life cross
So, when My boss offers me another way to change my job and attributor, actually I "survive" that job then, I suddenly see a different life possibility, and that means -- I have no justification any more. Such a grief! YOUR world flashs! 

Then I began a tough progress towards my new area: social media. I don't think that I prefer linking so many media opinion leader to arranging my life without the Internet(esp. Weibo.....)

### keep learning new things 
God knows how I conquered this awkward situation.

 I pushed myself to the brand new "dictionary" of "带货"/“出海”/“私域流量”/“种子客户”/“埋点”/“徒弟制”……

I talked all my new knowledge to the old-day teachers and friends, then I realized that they can't be with me when I just formed a happy atmosphere for myself to do some "missionary" speech, and no one listened：maybe none understand my logic.

even my dear dear friends didn't understand, some of my relatives judges me as a Amway-like saler, but what kind of good I sale to you？
None products.
I use this to argue, but most of them didn't wanna listen more.

all in all, in my 25, I would be optimistic and well-organized. Keep running, in the real world and in the visual racetrack, I definitely will NOT give up!
